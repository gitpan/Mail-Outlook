Mail::Outlook
=============

DESCRIPTION

This module was written to overcome the problem of sending mail messages, 
where Microsoft (R) Outlook (R) is the only mail application available.
However, since it's inception the module has expanded to handle a range of 
Outlook mail functionality.

Note that when sending messages, the module uses the named owner of the 
Outbox MAPI Folder in order to access the correct objects. Thus the From 
field of a new message is predetermined, and a read only property.

If using the 'Win32::OLE::Const' constants, only the following are currently 
supported:

  olFolderInbox
  olFolderOutbox
  olFolderSentMail
  olFolderDrafts
  olFolderDeletedItems

DEPENDENCIES

The distribution requires the following modules:

  Win32::OLE
  Win32::OLE::Const

For testing purposes, the following modules are desireable, but not essential:

  Test::Pod
  Test::Pod::Coverage

DISCLAIMER

Please note that there are no tests for the display, send, move or delete
methods, due to the potential havoc they could cause. You are advised to 
test this functionality safely should you need it. Any damage to your mail
environment is your sole responsibility. The software herein is provided as
is and the author accepts no liability as to its reliability.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make

TODO

  X-Header support - unlikely as Exchange ignores them
  Other Mail Folders
  More Tests
