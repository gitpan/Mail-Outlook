0.13	09/05/2007
	- Updated POD for attachments and new features.
	- Added Sent & Received methods to Outlook::Message, that correspond to
	  the date/time a sent mail was sent and received.
	- Fixed a long standing bug of why readonly mail wasn't returning any
	  values for the accessors.
	- Added tests for read functionality. Note that as all read tests will
	  read messages in your Inbox, to protect your privacy, you must set
	  the environment variable PRIVATE_TESTS for them to run.

	- Some items in a mail folder may actually be a MeetingItem or  a
	  AppointmentItem, which don't contain the same fields as a MailItem.

	  preferred solution. (Manjunath S.)
