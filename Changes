Revision history for Perl distribution Mail-Outlook.

0.23    2014-02-08
        Fixed 39711. Can now move a message from one folder to another.
        Fixed 29599. Can now list the names of the subfolders in a folder.
        Fixed 65393. Can now send mail from more than one account.
                
0.22    2013-12-16
        Fix syntax error.

0.21    2013-12-15
        Added Alien::Microsoft::Outlook as a dependency. Installation
        should now fail due to a missing dependency if Microsoft Outlook
        is not installed. If this works, I'll tidy up the tests in the
        next release.
        Altered Makefile.PL to mark this distribution as Windows only.
        
0.20    2013-12-14
        Fixed 89168 by deleting MYMETA files.
        Changed 91podcover so that it doesn't error if the require fails.
        Added 02load.t to test that the Outlook OLE constants have been
        imported. This will cause the installation to fail if Outlook
        is missing. I think that's more sensible that skipping the tests
        and installing anyway.

0.19    2013-09-07
        Last weeks release was indexed but did not pass CPAN Testers.
        Some POD was missing, 20folders.t still did not skip correctly
        if Mail::Outlook was missing, Changes file was not formatted
        correctly.
        
0.18    2013-08-31
        0.017_004 is a developer release so nothing happened. Try again.

0.17.4  2013-08-31
        0.17.1-4 are attempts to get the distribution on to CPAN and to
        get it passed by CPAN Testers. No new functionality.
        Copyright character changed to E<copy> to all three .pm files.
        20folders.t changed to skip if Outlook not installed.
        Use version numbering as in 
        http://www.dagolden.com/index.php/369/version-numbers-should-be-boring/
        so this one is 0.017_004.
        Version changed in various json and yml files.

          values for the accessors.

          read messages in your Inbox, to protect your privacy, you must set

        - Hidden Attachment fix implemented thanks to a patch by Fritz Zaucker
        - Message.pm now requires File::Basename to pass the filename of the

        - Some items in a mail folder may actually be a MeetingItem or  a
          AppointmentItem, which don't contain the same fields as a MailItem.
          A quick fix to return undef has been used, but this is not the
          preferred solution. (Manjunath S.)
